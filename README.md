###PTC Creo Configuration Files

PTC Creo Configuration Files (MapKeys, System Colors, Tree Configuration)

These should be placed in the installation directory of PTC Creo. Creo automatically loads all the *.pro and *.sup files from within the install directory to determine the system configuration. Make sure to delete the default ones to prevent them from being loaded as well.
